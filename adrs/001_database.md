# Choice of Database

# Status: accepted

# Context:

MongoDB is a cross-platform document oriented database program that'll be used 
as a database to store data while exploring basic Docker container operations.

# Decision:

MongoDB provides a cross-platform database with great features and capabilities
that work well with for storing data and pairing with nodes. In addition, I also 
chose MongoDB due to me being familiar with the software due to working with it in 
past projects. 

# Consequences:

Due to the efficient use of MongoDB, functional environments can be deployed
and used without requiring much effort or resources. This would likely make
it easier to deal with troubleshooting and debugging due to prior knowledge
of the software.
