# Choice of Provisioning tool

# Status: accepted

# Context:

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and 
application deployment tool 

# Decision:

For the most part, I chose to use Ansible in order to follow assignment guidelines, 
but it is a useful tool that can be used for provisioning IoT devices or server
infrastructures, configuring applications, and deployment. Moreover, it can 
simply manage versions of your applications and allows you to be able to revert back 
it is necessary. Also, it is not required for me to use servers, daemons, and 
databases since I an use Ansible as a host machine and Python on the targeted machines
with SSH access. 

# Consequences:

The simplicity of automating this application through the many tools provided this
software
